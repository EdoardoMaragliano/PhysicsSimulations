# Physics simulation
This repo contains code I developed during the course 'Simulation Methods Applied to Physics' during my BS in Physics @UniversityOfGenova (IT) in 2020/2021.

It was developed partly in C++, partly in Python. It could definitely use some refactoring. 

## Content
- ParticlePhysics: contains simulations of nuclear and particle physics experiments
- SolidStatePhysics: contains simulations of solid state physics experiments
