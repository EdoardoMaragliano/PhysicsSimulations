# Physics simulations
This repo contains code I developed during the course 'Simulation Methods Applied to Physics' during my BS in Physics @UniversityOfGenova (IT) in 2020/2021.

It was developed partly in C++, partly in Python. It could definitely use some refactoring, starting from translating variables/classes/functions from Italian to English to making it more efficient and graphically appealing when plotting stuff. It is a work in progress, with no purpose beyond having some fun trying to make old code a bit better.
